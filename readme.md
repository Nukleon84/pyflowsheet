# Pyflowsheet Project

This library is intended to support engineers creating simple process flow diagrams (PFD) from code, without the need for a complex chart drawing tool or CAD program.

The main use case would be to visualize flowsheets generated in textual modeling languages and to present results in a graphical manner.
